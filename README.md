# Ticking-Schedule

Schedule that slowly edits availability by changing background colors, and saves data for later.

## Description

![Webpage](./webpage.PNG)

I added the js for a website designed to save input, and change background based on the time. With this I was able to traverse the dom better as well as understand the abilities of varibles being filters for adapting data.
